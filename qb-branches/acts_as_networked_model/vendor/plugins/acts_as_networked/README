acts_as_network
===============

 This module adds the networking behaviour to an ActiveRecord model.
 The networking logic will use a support table to create n:m associations
 between objects.

 Example:

 class User < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_network :join_table => friends,
      :source_key => :id_user,
      :destination_key => :id_friend
 end

 first = users(:first)
 second = users(:second)

## Add a new connection

 first.connections << second

## Associate a role to a connection if you
## have the 'role' column in the join table

 first.connections.push_with_attributes(second, :role => 2)
 role = first.connections.find(second.id).role

## check for inclusion
 
 first.connections.include?(second)

Enjoy!
